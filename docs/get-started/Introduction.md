Shesha will automatically generate CRUD APIs and GraphQL endpoints, ensuring flexible and efficient data retrieval that can be easily authenticated and authorized through configuration.

2. **Build UI:** Utilize built-in or custom Reactjs components to construct the layout of your application.

3. **Write Logic:** Express your business logic using queries and JavaScript within the editor.
