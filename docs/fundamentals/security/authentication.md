# Authentication
Shesha's authentication framework is designed to provide a secure and flexible way to manage user authentication. It supports various authentication methods, including username/password, social logins, and external identity providers.

### Authentication Settings
The authentication settings can be configured in the application configuration files, allowing you to specify the authentication method, security policies, and other related settings. This includes options for password complexity, session timeouts, and multi-factor authentication.
