# Reference List Status

The RefListStatus component is Reflist bound. It takes full advantage of additional reflist's properties, giving you simple implementation of your status tags.

In the above example, a radio button has been dragged onto the designer so as to dynamically render the value of the reflist status component based on what has been selected.

## Content Properties

These properties are customizable options present in the property pane of the component, allowing users to modify the component according to their preferences. All of the properties contain a Javascript editor which allows users to execute Javascript expressions to control the component.

  - When checked, the DisplayName/RefList Name will be shown.

- **Show Icon**

  - When checked, the available icon will be visible on the left side of the RefListStatus tag, and the icon won't be visible when it's unchecked.

- **Show Solid Background**
  - When checked, the component will show a colored badge and display within it in white font the icon and/or the selected reference list item label. When it's unchecked, the component will just display the icon and/or the selected reference list item label using colored font.
