# Container

## Content Properties

These properties are customizable options present in the property pane of the component, allowing users to modify the component according to their preferences. All of the properties contain a Javascript editor which allows users to execute Javascript expressions to control the component.

- **No Default Styling**

  - This means that the element doesn't inherently come with any predefined appearance characteristics, and its visual presentation must be explicitly defined by the user or developer.

- **Display**

  - Specifies the display behavior (the type of rendering a container or box) of an element. It consists of 4 options:

    - **Flex:** Displays an element as a block-level flex container.
    - **Grid:** Displays an element as a block-level grid container.
    - **Block:** Displays an element as a block element (like `<p>`). It starts on a new line and takes up the whole width.
    - **Inline-Grid:** Displays an element as an inline-level grid container.

- **Flex-Direction**

  - Sets how flex items are placed in the flex container defining the main axis and the direction (normal or reversed). It consists of 6 options:

    - **Row:** The flexible items are displayed horizontally, as a row.
    - **Row-Reverse:** Same as row, but in reverse order.
    - **Column:** The flexible items are displayed vertically, as a column.
    - **Column-Reverse:** Same as column, but in reverse order.
    - **Initial:** Sets this property to its default value.
    - **Inherit:** Inherits this property from its parent element.

- **Flex-Wrap**

  - Is used to control the wrapping behavior of flex items within the flex container.

- **Align-Items**

  - Specifies the default alignment for items inside a flexbox or grid container. It consists of 6 options:

    - **Normal:** Default. Behaves like 'stretch' for flexbox and grid items, or 'start' for grid items with a defined block size.
    - **Stretch:** Items are stretched to fit the container.
    - **Center:** Items are positioned at the center of the container.
    - **Start:** Items are positioned at the beginning of their individual grid cells, in the block direction.
    - **End:** Items are positioned at the end of their individual grid cells, in the block direction.

- **Justify Content**

  - Property aligns the flexible container's items when the items do not use all available space on the main-axis (horizontally). It consists of several options:

    - **Flex-Start:** Default value. Items are positioned at the beginning of the container.
    - **Flex-End:** Items are positioned at the end of the container.
    - **Centre:** Items are positioned in the centre of the container.
    - **Space-Between:** Items will have space between them.
    - **Space-Around:** Items will have space before, between, and after them.
    - **Space-Evenly:** Items will have equal space around them.
    - **Initial:** Sets this property to its default value.
    - **Inherit:** Inherits this property from its parent element.

- **Custom CSS Class**

  - It's like a label for your webpage parts, allowing you to easily customize their appearance using your own design preferences.

- **Styling**

  - This is the section where you could incorporate your preferred design elements. For instance, you can specify the background color to be red, tailoring the visual aesthetics to suit your personal preferences.

- **Wrapper-Style**
