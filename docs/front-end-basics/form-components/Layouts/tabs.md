# Tabs

Tabs are used to organize content into separate sections or panes, where users can switch between these sections by clicking on the tabs. Each tab represents a different section, and only one section is visible at a time.

## Properties

The following properties are available to configure the behavior of the component from the form editor (this is in addition to [common properties](/docs/front-end-basics/form-components/common-component-properties.md).

### Tab Type

- The tab type can either be a card or a line.
- Both the line and card tabs disable tabs that are currently not active, and the tab that is currently visible is seen by having a different color than the rest of the tabs.

### Size

- This will set the size for all buttons

### Position

- The user is able to configure the position of the tab. The user has an option to configure the tab on top, left, bottom, or on the right.

### Configure Tab Panes

      - The user can use the configure tabs option to add the tabs that they want to have.

  <!-- ![Configure Tab Panes]() -->

### Title

- Allows the user to add their own title to the tab.

### Animated

- The user can choose if they want the tabs to transition between the tabs to be animated.

### Destroy Inactive Tab Pane

- Allows the user to choose whether the inactive tab panes should be destroyed or removed from memory when a user switches from one tab to another.
