# Divider

The Divider is used to create a sense of order, separate different types of content, and improve the overall reading experience by guiding the reader through the document.

### The Divider can help you:

- Divide sections of an article.
- Divide inline text and links such as the operation column of a table.
- Differentiating Between Comments or Notes.

## Properties

The following properties are available to configure the behavior of the component from the form editor (this is in addition to [common properties](/docs/front-end-basics/form-components/common-component-properties)).

### Container

Has a data type of Boolean and is set to false by default. When it is set to true, it means that the component can have and display nested elements or components as its children.

### Divider Type

We have two types of dividers, namely: `horizontal` and `vertical`. The default direction for the divider is `horizontal`. You can change it to `vertical` using a dropdown menu.

### Content Type

The content inside the divider is initially positioned on the left by default. You can change its position to the right or center using a dropdown menu.

### Orientation Margin

The margin on the left or right side between the content and its closest border is applicable when the orientation is set to `left` or `right`.

### Dashed

When the checkbox is clicked, the divider line becomes dashed. By default, it is set to false.

### Plain

The divider line becomes plain when the checkbox is clicked. By default, it is set to false, and the divider line is plain by default.
