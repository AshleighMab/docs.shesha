# Columns

Columns are used to organize content horizontally, allowing for a flexible and responsive design. This uses the Ant Design's 24 columns' grid.

## Properties

The following properties are available to configure the behavior of the component from the form editor (this is in addition to [common properties](/docs/front-end-basics/form-components/common-component-properties).

### Gutter X
 Gutter X helps you to create gaps between column content for horizontal padding.

### Gutter Y
 Gutter Y helps you to create gaps between column content for vertical padding.

### Configure Columns

- **Width** – you can change the width size of the column until maximum of `24`.
- **Offset** – you can change the original position of the column by putting the number that will create the space between the origan position of the column and starting position.
- **Push** – to push the column to the right side.
- **Pull** – to pull the column from the right.
