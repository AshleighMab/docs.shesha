# Columns

Columns are used to organize content horizontally, allowing for a flexible and responsive design. This uses the Ant Design's 24 columns' grid.

## Content Properties

These properties are customizable options present in the property pane of the component, allowing users to modify the component according to their preferences. All of the properties contain a Javascript editor which allows users to execute Javascript expressions to control the component.

### Gutter X

- Gutter X helps you to create gaps between column content for horizontal padding.

### Gutter Y

- Gutter Y helps you to create gaps between column content for vertical padding.

### Configure Columns

- **Width** – you can change the width size of the column until maximum of `24`.
- **Offset** – you can change the original position of the column by putting the number that will create the space between the origan position of the column and starting position.
- **Push** – to push the column to the right side.
- **Pull** – to pull the column from the right.
