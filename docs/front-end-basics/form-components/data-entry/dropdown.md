## **Properties**

The following properties are available to configure the behavior of the component from the form editor (this is in addition to [common properties](/docs/front-end-basics/form-components/common-component-properties)).

#### **Property Name** ``string``

The internal name of the field, used to bind it to data. This is essential for the component to function properly in the form.

*Note: In our examples, you might see a property name like ``gender``. This is just for illustration â€” you're free to name the property whatever suits your domain.*

#### **Label** ``string``

Controls whether the label for the component should be shown. Optionally hides it for a cleaner UI.

#### **Placeholder** ``string``

Text shown when no option is selected. Handy for prompting users on what to choose.

#### **Tooltip** ``string``

A helper text shown when hovering over the component .

#### **Edit Mode** ``object``

Toggles between Editable, Read Only, or Inherited from the form. Flexible for all kinds of scenarios.

#### **Hide** ``boolean``

Controls the visibility of the dropdown.
