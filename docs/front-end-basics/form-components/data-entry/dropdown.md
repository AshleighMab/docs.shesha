## **Properties**

The following properties are available to configure the behavior of the component from the form editor (this is in addition to [common properties](/docs/front-end-basics/form-components/common-component-properties)).

### Data

#### **Default Value** ``string``

Set a pre-selected default item. Especially useful when you want to provide an initial value.

#### **Mode** ``Object``

Switch between single *(default)*, multiple, or tag selection.

#### **DataSource Type** ``Object``

Choose how the dropdown gets its values: from static values *(default)*, reference lists, or a remote URL.

#### **Value** 

Manually define the dropdown entries via label-value pairs. Ideal for short, custom lists.
