# Html Render
The Html Render component allows you to inject custom JSX or HTML-like structures directly into your form. It is useful for embedding styled text, headings, images, or any other custom layout elements that arenâ€™t tied to form data. This component provides great way to add visual context or instructional content between interactive form elements.
