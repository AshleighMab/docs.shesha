# Event Handlers

Event handlers are functions or methods that are designed to respond to specific events or triggers within a software application. These events can be user interactions, system events, or changes in the application state. Event handlers play a crucial role in controlling the flow of an application and responding to various scenarios. Let's explore the benefits of event handlers in the context of: `onChange`, `onFocus`, `onBlur`, and `onSelect`.

These events contain a standard list of variables that give the user access to certain variables and functions facilitating the need to respond to various scenarios. Namely:

- `form data`
- `event` callback when an input is made
- current `mode` of the form
- A function used `setFormData`
- `moment` function for DateTime operations
- `ParentFormValues`
- `InitialValues`
- `toast message` functionality
- `form instance`
- `axios instance used to make http requests`

## onChange

## onFocus

Supports Javascript expressions used when an element gets focus.

## onBlur

Supports Javascript expressions used when an element loses focus.

## onSelect

An event which is triggered every time an address is selected.
