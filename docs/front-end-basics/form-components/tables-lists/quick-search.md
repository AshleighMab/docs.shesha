# Quick Search

The Quick Search component is a user interface element designed to enable fast and efficient searching within a dataset, often used in applications displaying large amounts of information. It provides a quick and simple way for users to find specific data within a table, list, or any structured display. This component should be used within a [Datatable Context Component](/docs/front-end-basics/form-components/tables-lists/datatable-context).
