# Table View Selector

The Table View Selector is a user interface component commonly found in applications, particularly those dealing with tabular or list-based data. It allows users to switch between different predefined views or filters of the data presented in a table format. This component provides a list of configurable query builders that can be used to configure the different predefined filters and views. This component should be used within a [Datatable Context Component](/docs/front-end-basics/form-components/tables-lists/datatable-context).
