# Table Pager

The Table Pager component is a user interface element used in applications that display large sets of data in a tabular or paginated format. Its primary function is to break down the dataset into manageable sections or pages, enabling users to navigate through the data easily. This component should be used within a [Datatable Context Component](/docs/front-end-basics/form-components/tables-lists/datatable-context).
