# Toggling Edit Mode

The Shesha dashboard, various forms, and pages can be edited by toggling the edit mode. To do this, click the edit button (pencil icon) located in the top right corner.

**Important:** The edit mode button is visible only if the current user have been assigned the correct role, with this permission: `app:Configurator`

After clicking the edit mode button, you will be prompted to confirm your intention to access this mode.

Select `OK` to proceed with the edit mode.

## Edit Mode Areas

Once you have entered edit mode, there are three main edit areas that you can interact with:

1. [Main Menu](/docs/settings/settings-overview#main-menu-settings)
2. **Logo**
3. **View**
