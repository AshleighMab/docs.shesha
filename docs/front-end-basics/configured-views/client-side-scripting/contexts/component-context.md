# Component contexts

Some components provide access to their data and, in some cases, to their own API through the context. Not all components have a context. The components also have different datasets and APIs.

After adding a component to the form, its context appears in the context list. For example, after adding a DataTableContext and a DataTable, their context will be added to the list of contexts

Different components have different fields and APIs.

For example, fields of DataTableContext
